Web Calculator using html5, css3 and JavaScript.
The code for structure (HTML) and basic arithmetic calculation (Javascript) logic is accredited to https://www.codewithharry.com/.
Further I added more CSS styles like button glow effect when hovering with a gradient color theme and the Javascript logic for invalid entries from the users.
